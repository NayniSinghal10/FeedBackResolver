Analyze the entire block of text provided below, which contains multiple emails. Your task is to read all of them and generate a single, consolidated Markdown report that categorizes the key information from every email.

Do not skip any email. Every piece of information should be sorted into an appropriate category.

The final report should have the following structure. For each category, list the relevant items from the emails, making sure to mention who the request is from.

**Consolidated Merchant Communication Report**

### Technical Queries & Issues
*   [e.g., "User can't find a refund in the dashboard (From: Megha)"]
*   [e.g., "User is not able to trigger a forgot password email (From: gaurav.taneja@arvindfashions.com)"]

### Feature & Implementation Requests
*   [e.g., "Request to start sending full URL and UTM parameters in order notes (From: Juspay Team email)"]
*   [e.g., "User wants to know if they can customize their cart page (From: sayednehalibrahim@gmail.com)"]

### Service & Billing Changes
*   [e.g., "Request to discontinue Juspay service and not raise an invoice for July (From: Marketing ReFit)"]
*   [e.g., "Details on new Partial COD payment terms (From: Team email)"]

### Meeting & Scheduling Requests
*   [e.g., "Request to schedule a technical call for tomorrow at 12:30pm (From: Gautam Jain)"]

### General Inquiries & Communications
*   [e.g., "Sharing a Pipecat plugin guide and asking about interest in a Slack channel (From: Michael Miller)"]

**Important Rules:**
*   Accurately categorize every email's content.
*   Ensure every email is represented in the final report.
*   Do not invent or add any information that is not explicitly present in the text.
