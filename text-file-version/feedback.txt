"Hi team,

We would like to discontinue the Juspay service for the time being. As suggested by our marketing team, we are shifting to a native Shopify flow and are currently facing some issues with UTM sourcing.

Please do not raise an invoice for the month of July. We will get back to you as soon as possible regarding recommencing our service.

Thank you for your understanding.

Best regards,
Marketing ReFit"

"Swaroop, thanks so much for letting me know! Here is our Pipecat plugin guide to help you get started with testing the integration.

Separately, are you and your team on Slack? Most organizations we work with find it very helpful to have a Slack Connect channel between our teams, as it provides you direct access to our engineering and support resources throughout your testing and evaluation. 

Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in, and I can get a channel set up for us. Thank you!
