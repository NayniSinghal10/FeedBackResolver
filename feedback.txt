I was trying to complete the payment but it failed twice. I’m not sure if the issue was on my end or with the gateway. Also, the UI is decent but a bit slow on older devices. One more thing I noticed: the text in the onboarding screens gets cut off on smaller screens. Would be great if that's looked into.

Really like the overall layout of the platform. It feels clean and not too overwhelming. However, the search functionality seems off — I was looking for something very specific and the results were not relevant. Also, I’d appreciate if there's a filter option to sort content more easily.

It’s working well mostly but the app tends to freeze sometimes when switching between tabs. I had to restart it twice yesterday. Also, there’s a small typo in the help section — under FAQs. Not a huge issue but thought I’d point it out. Otherwise, it’s been quite useful for my needs.

I’ve been using it for about a week now. Navigation is intuitive and the responsiveness is good. Just a suggestion — the font size in the settings page could be slightly larger. And if possible, please add a night mode. I usually work late, and it would help reduce strain.

I appreciate the effort put into the design and performance. The latest update did improve the load times significantly. However, I noticed that the back button doesn’t always behave as expected. Sometimes it closes the app instead of going back to the previous screen.

The onboarding was simple and clear, which is great. I had no trouble understanding how to get started. One issue though — I didn’t receive a confirmation email after signing up, so I had to request it again manually. Maybe that process can be improved.

The functionality is solid overall, and it covers most of the use cases I care about. One feature I’m missing is the ability to bookmark or save items for later. That would be really helpful. Also, there was a slight lag when loading the dashboard this morning.
